# Drill-Down Dashboard Aggregation Fix

## ✅ The Issue Has Been Fixed!

The drill-down dashboard was showing multiple rows for the same week when filtering by a specific dimension value (like Channel Grouping = "Email"). This happened because the `weekly_breakdown` view contains all dimension columns, resulting in multiple rows per week with different values in other dimensions.

## How It's Fixed

The dashboard now **automatically aggregates** data when you filter by a specific dimension value:

- **Before**: 1000+ rows with duplicates → Confusing multiple rows per week
- **After**: Aggregated into clean weekly totals → One row per week

### Current Status: Client-Side Aggregation (Working Now!)

The dashboard is currently using **client-side aggregation** which:
- ✅ Works immediately without any database changes
- ✅ Properly sums sessions, demos, and signups for each week
- ✅ Shows correct week-over-week comparisons

You'll see messages like this in the console:
```
[Drill-Down] Aggregated 1000 rows into 15 weekly records for source="google"
```

### Optional: Enable Server-Side Aggregation (Better Performance)

For better performance with large datasets, you can enable server-side aggregation:

1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL from `CREATE_AGGREGATE_RPC.sql`
4. The dashboard will automatically use the faster server-side aggregation

After enabling, you'll see:
```
[Drill-Down] Server-aggregated 15 weekly records for source="google"
```

## Summary

- **Problem**: Multiple rows per week when filtering
- **Solution**: Smart aggregation that sums metrics by week
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and working (client-side)
- **Optional**: Run the RPC SQL for better performance (not required)
