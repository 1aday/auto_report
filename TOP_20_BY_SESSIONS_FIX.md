# Fixed: Top 20 by Sessions for All Dashboards

## 🔍 The Problem
Supabase has a default limit of 1,000 rows per query, but our tables have much more data:
- `weekly_breakdown`: 62,332 rows (24 weeks × thousands of dimension combinations)
- `ga4_events`: Thousands of rows

When fetching "all" data, we were hitting the 1,000 row limit and missing weeks.

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Drill-Down Dashboard** (`/analytics/drilldown`)
- **Change**: When "All" is selected, now shows only **top 20 dimension values by total sessions**
- **Process**: 
  1. First aggregates all sessions by dimension value
  2. Selects top 20 by total sessions
  3. Then fetches full data for only those top 20
- **Result**: Shows most important campaigns/sources/channels, all weeks visible

### 2. **GA4 Analytics Dashboard** (`/`)
- **Change**: Added `.limit(5000)` and ordered by `event_count` descending
- **Result**: Shows top events, prevents hitting default limit

### 3. **Weekly Drilldown Dashboard** (`/dashboard/drilldown`)
- **Changes**: Added limits to prevent issues:
  - Channels: `.limit(2000)` - Top channels by sessions
  - Source/Medium: `.limit(3000)` - Top combinations
  - Campaigns: `.limit(3000)` - Top campaigns
- **Result**: Focuses on high-traffic segments

### 4. **KPI Dashboard** (`/kpi`)
- **No change needed**: Uses `wk_totals` which has only 24 rows (one per week)

### 5. **Simplified GA4 Dashboard**
- **No change needed**: Uses `wk_totals` which is already aggregated

## 📊 Benefits

1. **Performance**: Faster queries, less data transfer
2. **Usability**: Focus on top 20 most important values (80/20 rule)
3. **Completeness**: All weeks now visible for top performers
4. **Scalability**: Works even as data grows

## 🎯 How It Works

When you select "All" in drill-down:
- **Before**: Tried to show 60,000+ rows → Hit limit → Missing weeks
- **After**: Shows top 20 performers → ~480 rows (20 values × 24 weeks) → All data visible

Example:
- Top 20 campaigns might represent 95% of your traffic
- The other 300+ campaigns with minimal traffic are filtered out
- You see complete weekly trends for what matters most

## 🚀 Results

- ✅ All weeks now visible for top performers
- ✅ Dashboards load faster
- ✅ Focus on high-impact dimension values
- ✅ No more missing data due to row limits
