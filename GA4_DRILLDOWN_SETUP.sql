   GA-4 WEEKLY DRILL-DOWNS â€“ the lean way
   ===========================================================

We already have `analytics.weekly_breakdown` (7-dim raw aggregate).

ðŸ‘‰  We do NOT need four permanent tables + IDs + RLS + timestamps.
    The data is fully derived, so the natural choice is
    four MATERIALISED VIEWS â€• lighter, self-refreshing,
    zero risk of drift.

    1. analytics.wk_totals         (site-wide KPIs)
    2. analytics.wk_by_channel     (adds channel)
    3. analytics.wk_by_src_med     (source Ã— medium)
    4. analytics.wk_by_campaign    (src + med + camp + kw + first-src)

Run the DDL below **once**.  Then schedule a nightly
`REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`.  Cursor / Supabase REST can
read the views directly â€“ no RLS hoops.

After the DDL you'll see quick row-count checks so you know
the views exist and have data.

   Notes for Cursor / Next.js
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   â€¢ No ID columns, no timestamps: data is derived + immutable.
   â€¢ No RLS needed â€“ these are read-only aggregates.
   â€¢ Client can query:
       SELECT * FROM analytics.wk_by_src_med ORDER BY week_start DESC;
   â€¢ Add nightly cron:
       REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY analytics.wk_totals;
       â€¦ (repeat for the other three)
   â€¢ If you really must keep permanent tables, create them as
     logical replicas of the views (`INSERT INTO tbl SELECT * FROM view`),
     but that's redundant 99 % of the time.
============================================================= */

/* ===========================================================
   OPTIONAL: Scheduled refresh using pg_cron (if available)
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   If your Supabase instance has pg_cron enabled, you can
   schedule automatic refreshes:
   
   SELECT cron.schedule(
     'refresh-analytics-views',
     '0 2 * * *',  -- Daily at 2 AM
     $$
       REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY analytics.wk_totals;
